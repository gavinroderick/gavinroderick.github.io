        <h3>
          hi there!
        </h3>
        <p>
          welcome to my digital home.
          <br><br>
          i've been making things on the web professionally for about a decade, working across a range of industries
          from aviation, to agri-tech & most recently finance.
          <br><br>
          currently, i'm working as a security engineer, alongside postgraduate study at Abertay University.

        <h3>work</h3>
        <p>
          most of my career so far has been split between full-stack & backend development.
          <br><br>
          .net is my go-to framework to reach for, but i'm equally comfortable working in typescript & python.
          <br><br>
          to get things deployed, i now usually work with a combination of aws & terraform, having started off in the
          world of azure.

      <section id="education">
        <h3>education</h3>
        <p>
          i believe in lifelong learning, supplementing formal education with constant on job upskilling
          <br><br>
          i hold a bachelors degree in applied computing from the university of dundee, and i'm currently working
          towards a masters in ethical hacking & cybersecurity at abertay university.
          <br><br>
          alongside formal learning, i seek every opportunity to learn new tools and frameworks - having a bigger
          toolbox allows me to pick the right tool for a given task.
          <br><br>
          outside of the tech world, i'm a fan of languages. i speak conversational portuguese, and while a bit rusty, i
          can get by with german.

      <section id="blog">
        <h3>blog</h3>
        <p>
          like a of people, i've had great intentions of starting a blog for years. sadly, i seem to get one or two
          posts in before life takes over & i forget it exists
          <br><br>
          i'll be attempting to keep it more upto date this time around, and i suppose we'll all see in a year or so
          whether i'm successful
